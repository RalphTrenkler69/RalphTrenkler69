My name is Ralph Trenkler, I am student of physics and want to share the programs 
I developed for my studies with others. First, I published my scientific plot 
programs, which are three programs to visualize geometric data.
My german homepage is https://www.ralph-trenkler.de. There you can see installation
instructions for Ubuntu 22.04 and the manual pages of the programs.
